📊 Python Data Analysis & Visualization Project
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to load, clean, analyze, and visualize data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
The workflow follows three main tasks:

Load and Explore a dataset

Perform Basic Data Analysis

Create Data Visualizations

It is designed to give practice in data wrangling, statistical analysis, and creating insightful visualizations.

⚙️ Requirements

Before running the scripts, install the required Python libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn


Optional:
If using the Iris dataset via scikit-learn:

pip install scikit-learn

📂 Project Structure
├── dataset.csv         # Example dataset (can be replaced with your own)
├── analysis.py         # Main script with data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualizations
├── README.md           # Documentation (this file)

🚀 How to Run

Clone or download this repository.

Place your dataset (CSV format) in the project folder.

Run the script:

python analysis.py

📑 Tasks
Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

Load CSV using Pandas.

Inspect data with .head() and .info().

Check missing values with .isnull().sum().

Clean the dataset (fill/drop missing values).

Task 2: Basic Data Analysis

Compute descriptive statistics with .describe().

Group data by a categorical column and calculate mean values.

Identify patterns or interesting findings.

Task 3: Data Visualization

Using Matplotlib & Seaborn:

📈 Line chart (trends over time).

📊 Bar chart (numerical comparison across categories).

📉 Histogram (distribution of a numerical column).

🔵 Scatter plot (relationship between two numerical columns).

All plots include titles, axis labels, and legends for clarity.

🔒 Error Handling

File not found → handled with try/except.

Missing data → handled by filling/dropping.

Incorrect data types → warnings displayed.

🌍 Ubuntu Principles in Action

Community: Connects to open datasets shared worldwide.

Respect: Handles errors gracefully.

Sharing: Organizes clean, shareable insights.

Practicality: Real-world tool for exploring datasets.

📌 Example Dataset Options

Iris Dataset (sklearn.datasets.load_iris)
